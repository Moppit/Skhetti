- Write my own simple programming language! (Make it as close to
pseudocode as possible… something that is easy and intuitive to use) [instead of
print and file be separate, have input and output where you specify stream;
shell is default, but if you add a param, you can do it with files] [use the
CSCI 3155 notes to guide you, seem pithy and you have to read it anyway]

    - Describes features to work on developing or to consider very well: https://hackernoon.com/lets-build-a-programming-language-2612349105c6
        - Also it’s a series, so will guide through the implementation of each thing
